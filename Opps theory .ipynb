What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n","  - OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects containing data (attributes) and behavior (methods), enabling modularity, reusability, and abstraction.\n","\n","2. What is a class in OOP\n","  - A class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects.\n","\n","3. What is an object in OOP\n","  - An object is an instance of a class that contains its own data and can perform actions defined by the class.\n","\n","4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation\n","  - Abstraction hides implementation details and focuses on what to do, while  encapsulation restricts direct access to data by wrapping it with methods.\n","\n","5. What are dunder methods in Python\n","  - Dunder methods are special methods with double underscores before and after their names, used to define custom behavior for built-in operations.\n","\n","6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n","  - Inheritance allows one class to acquire properties and behaviors of another class, promoting code reuse.\n","\n","7. What is polymorphism in OOP\n","  -  Polymorphism allows different classes to define methods with the same name but potentially different behaviors.\n","\n","8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python\n","  - Encapsulation is achieved using private/protected attributes and providing public methods to access or modify them.\n","\n","9. What is a constructor in Python\n","  - A constructor is a special method __init__ that is automatically called when an object is created to initialize attributes.\n","\n","10. What are class and static methods in Python\n","   - Class methods operate on the class itself and are defined with @classmethod. Static methods perform general tasks and are defined with @staticmethod.\n","\n","11. What is method overloading in Python\n","   - Python does not support true method overloading; instead, it can be simulated using default arguments or variable-length arguments.\n","\n","12. What is method overriding in OOP\n","   - Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides its own implementation of a method already defined in the parent class.\n","\n","13. What is a property decorator in Python\n","   - A property decorator @property allows defining methods that can be accessed like attributes.\n","\n","14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP\n","   - Polymorphism enhances flexibility by allowing code to work with different object types through a common interface.\n","\n","15. What is an abstract class in Python\n","   - An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods that must be implemented in subclasses.\n","\n","16. What are the advantages of OOP\n","   - OOP provides modularity, code reuse, scalability, maintainability, and easier problem modeling.\n","\n","17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable\n","   - A class variable is shared by all instances, while an instance variable is unique to each object.\n","\n","18. What is multiple inheritance in Python\n","   - Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class.\n","\n","19. Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python\n","   - __str__ defines a readable string representation for end users, while __repr__ defines a developer-focused representation.\n","\n","20. What is the significance of the super() function in Python\n","   - super() is used to call methods from a parent class, often within method overrides.\n","\n","21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python\n","   - __del__ is a destructor method called when an object is about to be destroyed to perform cleanup actions.\n","\n","22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python\n","   - A static method doesn’t take self or cls and cannot modify object or class state; a class method takes cls and can modify class state.\n","\n","23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance\n","   -  With inheritance, polymorphism allows a subclass to override methods from its parent so that the correct method is called based on the object’s type.\n","\n","24. What is method chaining in Python OOP\n","   - Method chaining is calling multiple methods sequentially on the same object in a single statement, with each method returning the object itself.\n","\n","25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python\n","   -  __call__ allows an object to be called like a function by defining custom behavior when the object is invoked."],"metadata":{"id":"DSebrCa7idOy"}}]}
